**OBJECTIVE:** To learn how to utilize various packet capture and protocol analyzer tools, such as Wireshark and Tcpdump, and help identify risk, vulnerabilities, and threats associated with traffic.

**Project Description:** This project contains two traffic captures, one captured with Wireshark and the other with tcpdump. These captures were saved as packet capture (pcap) files and later used for protocol analysis using Wireshark filters and tcpdump capture filters, as further documented in this report.

**Tools Used:**

* Wireshark  
* Tcpdump
* Snipping Tool.  
* Kali VM.

| Tools Used  | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Wireshark | This is a cross-platform network protocol analyzer tool that provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface(GUI) for users to analyze and filter  traffic running on their networks, and it is perfect for anomaly detection, troubleshooting network issues, protocol analysis, and security analysis, such as spotting misconfigurations, identifying malware.   |
| Tcpdump | This is  a Command Line     Interface (CLI) Network packet capture and protocol analyzer that is capable of capturing live traffic and widely used for network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and is particularly suited to Unix-like operating Systems |
| Snipping Tool  | This was used to capture various vital screenshots shown in this report. |
| Kali VM | This is the Virtual Machine OS used to practice tcpdump commands and capture its traffic. |
