### OpenSSL Cryptography and PKI Documentation

This Project serves as a practical, command-line-focused guide to core cryptographic operations using the OpenSSL toolkit. It covers essential security practices and provides step-by-step commands for:
Symmetric Encryption: Generating secure keys and encrypting/decrypting files using algorithms like AES-256-CBC.
Asymmetric Encryption: Creating and managing RSA private and public key pairs, followed by their use for file encryption and decryption.
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Establishing a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA), generating user Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), and issuing trusted certificates.
Digital Signatures: Authenticating the source and integrity of documents using private keys and verification with public keys (non-repudiation).
This resource is ideal for users looking to understand and implement fundamental security functions in their environment using the versatile OpenSSL utility.
