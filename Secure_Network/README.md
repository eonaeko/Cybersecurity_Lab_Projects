**Description:** This Project shows a simulation of a network architecture setup where a secure small enterprise network with three core department  Administration, Sales and IT support form the following Vlans: ADMIN\_VLAN, SALES\_VLAN, IT\_VLAN which were allowed to communicate through inter-vlan routing and secured through the use of Access Control List (ACLS) for least privilege of access and secure remote access through SSH for management of critical infrastructure. 

**TOOLS USED:**

* Virtual Box   
* Windows 10 Client  
* Cisco Packet Tracer  
* Layer3 switch  
* PCs   
* Snipping tool


| Tools Used  | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Virtual Box  | This acts as the hypervisor used to simulate this lab  |
| Windows 10 client  | This is the base operating system upon which the applications used for this lab would run |
| Cisco Packet Tracer  | This is the application used for this lab setup, including the network architecture design, configuration, and testing  |
| Layer3 Switch | This was the choice device for my network architecture; it possesses the ability to perform inter-vlan routing  |
| PCs | There are about 8 PCs used in the network architecture  |
| Snipping Tool | This was used to take various vital screenshots that are shown in this report.  |
