**Description**:  This project shows the virtualization of three computers (which are Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Client, Parrot OS)  networked together to show how virtual machines communicate and how to set up Windows Server to act as a Domain Controller (corp.local) and create users to join the domain through the Windows 10 client  and finally the Parrot OS is used to carry service enumeration and Password attacks 

**TOOLS USED:**

* VMware Workstation  
* Parrot OS  
* Windows 10 Client  
* Windows Server 2022  
* Snipping Tool

| Tools Used  | Description  |
| :---- | :---- |
| VMware Workstation | This acts as the hypervisor used to simulate this lab  |
| Parrot OS | This was used to act as the attacker in this lab to carry out the password attacks and enumeration  |
| Windows Server 2022 | This was used to create the domain, create an Active Directory that stores users who created and groups that users belong to, and it acted as the DNS server in this lab  |
| Windows 10 client  | This was used as the device used by the users to join the domain (corp.local) created in the Windows Server |
| Snipping local | This was used to take various vital screenshots that are shown in this report.  |
