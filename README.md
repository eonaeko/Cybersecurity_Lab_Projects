# Project 1: Virtual Cybersecurity Lab Setup 

Objective 
To simulate a secure, real-world environment for offensive and defensive security testing through Virtual Machines

### Environment Setup

-VirtualBox 
-Kali Linux VM
-Windows 10 VM

### Procedure 

### Choose one major incident and explain its impact and key lesson learned.

**The SolarWinds Cyberattack in 2020:**  In this incident, Attackers installed a backdoor called **SUNBURUST** into a software update of SolarWinds Orion which is widely used for Networking Monitoring which lead to spying vital and confidential information, the attack was largely attributed to the nation state actors of Russia 

**Key lessons learned:** there should a lot of defense mechanisms put in place not just at the  perimeter and that there should 3rd party compliance checks ensuring supply chain security.

### What are the main trend in threat evolution has been since the 2010s.

**Stuxnet Computer Worm in 2010** : targeted SCADA systems through programmable logic controllers, managing to work through Windows machines and networks replicating itself severally

**Duqu 2011**: it  was designed to steal information by disguising data transmissions such as normal HTTP traffic and transferring fake JPG files.

**Havex 2013:** this was a notable remote access Trojan and as it target ICS systems and communicated with C2 server to deploy modular payloads
