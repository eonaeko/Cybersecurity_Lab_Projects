### Project Title: Wazuh Agent Deployment and File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on Windows

- ### Description:

This project details the successful deployment of the Wazuh Security Platform in a VMware environment and the subsequent installation and configuration of a Wazuh agent on a Windows endpoint. It focuses specifically on implementing File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) by modifying the agent's ossec.conf file to track changes to critical files (e.g., c:\demo\important_document.txt). The documentation confirms the FIM setup by verifying the detection of file modifications and deletions on the Wazuh dashboard. The project also highlights Wazuh's capabilities for compliance monitoring, including PCI DSS and GDPR.
